# Advent of Rust 2023

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023, in Rust!
This is not the most "Rusty" nor efficient way, I'm simply trying to do more Rust; I'm not really concerned with the algorithm itself.
However, feel free to comment on code efficiency (runtime/memory).

## Dependencies

I understand that some dependencies can provide more concise/performant parsing for example. However, 
I'm trying to avoid using dependencies as much as possible, while keeping the code easy to understand.

So far, I'm only allowing myself to use itertools for things like producing combinations or collecting into tuples and basic math stuff like LCMs.

## Contributions

Please feel free to leave a PR with suggestions, as I'm also trying to learn more about rust.
